# IPL Data Analysis using Spark, Databricks, and Amazon S3

This project focuses on analyzing Indian Premier League (IPL) data using Apache Spark for distributed data processing, Databricks for scalable data analytics, and Amazon S3 as cloud storage. The aim is to explore trends, player performance, team stats, and other insights from IPL data.

## Project Overview
The Indian Premier League (IPL) is one of the biggest T20 cricket leagues globally, offering rich data that can provide insights into team strategies, player performance, and match outcomes. This project analyzes IPL datasets to uncover patterns and trends in various aspects of the game. 

### Key Goals:
- Perform ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) using Spark.
- Visualize insights using Databricks notebooks.
- Store and retrieve data from Amazon S3.
- Analyze trends such as top run-scorers, best bowlers, and win/loss patterns over seasons.

## Technologies Used
- **Apache Spark**: For distributed data processing and transformation.
- **Databricks**: For scalable data analytics and visualization.
- **Amazon S3**: For cloud storage of IPL datasets.
- **Python**: For scripting and data manipulation.
- **Pandas**: For handling data frames within Databricks.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For visualization.
- **SQL**: For querying data in Databricks.

## Data Sources
The dataset includes:
- IPL match details: Results, scores, player stats, venues.
- Player performance data: Runs, wickets, and other individual statistics.
  
Datasets are stored in CSV format on Amazon S3.

## Architecture
1. **Data Storage**: IPL datasets are uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket.
2. **Data Ingestion**: Spark reads data from the S3 bucket.
3. **Data Processing**: Using Spark DataFrames to clean and transform the data.
4. **Analysis**: Running SQL queries in Databricks and visualizing key metrics using Python libraries.
5. **Results and Insights**: Storing results back into S3 or displaying them in Databricks notebooks.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites:
1. **AWS Account**: Required to create and manage S3 buckets.
2. **Databricks Account**: For creating notebooks and running Spark jobs.
3. **Apache Spark**: Installed locally or accessed via Databricks.
4. **Python Libraries**: Install Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

### Steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/IPL_Data_Analysis.git
   cd IPL_Data_Analysis
   ```
2. Set up Amazon S3 bucket for data storage.
   - Upload IPL datasets to the S3 bucket.
   - Ensure proper IAM permissions for accessing the bucket.

3. Configure Databricks:
   - Set up a Databricks cluster.
   - Upload notebooks and configure S3 access.

4. Use Spark to read data from S3:
   ```python
   df = spark.read.csv("s3://your-bucket-name/ipl_data.csv", header=True, inferSchema=True)
   ```

5. Run transformations and analysis on the dataset using Spark and Databricks SQL.

## Exploratory Analysis
In this project, the following analysis will be performed:
- **Player Performance**: Top run-scorers, wicket-takers, and strike rates.
- **Team Statistics**: Wins, losses, and overall season performance.
- **Venue Trends**: How venues affect match outcomes.
- **Toss Decisions**: Impact of winning the toss on match results.

## Results
The analysis has provided insights such as:
- Identification of consistent performers across IPL seasons.
- Key factors that influence match outcomes (e.g., toss, venue).
- Patterns in player performance, such as highest runs, strike rate, and economy rate.
